# My Codewars Repo

A collection of my Codewars challenge solutions. Updated daily.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** mostly JavaScript with some HTML and CSS for browser testing.

My process of solving these coding challenges has changed since I started, but I make sure to complete at least one of the 8kyu challenges every day. Currently, I am using the P.R.E.P. method (Parameters, Result, Example, Pseudocode) to give the solving process more structure and consistency. I also try to add alternate solutions for each completed challenge to cover different approaches to coding such as best practices, concise body, and sometimes just interesting or clever solutions.

## Optimizations

After every coding challenge is finished, I save a copy locally that I can go back and refactor for any number of reasons. I am currently in the process of adding the P.R.E.P. method steps to all of my previously completed coding solutions and I will also refactor the finished code to make it more efficient if needed and add alternate solutions as I learn more ways to solve them. I am also in the process of sorting all of these challenges by difficulty and by date so it is easier to search through.

## Lessons Learned:

Every completed challenge adds more knowledge to my coding arsenal and allows me to approach the same problem in several different ways. When a coding challenge is completed and submitted on Codewars, you are immediately shown a list of other coders' solutions and often a discussion breaking down how each one was solved. Even if I have solved a specific or similar challenge before, there will always be a new or different way to go about resolving it so I can practice a technique I won't normally use otherwise in the process. 
For example, there was an 8kyu challenge involving the evaluation of a string as if it were an expression and returning the result as a number. This was earlier on in my experience with coding challenges so I just came up with a basic solution using the Number() function and various string and array methods to convert everything. After I submitted my solution, I found another coder had answered the same problem using a function I had never tried before: eval(). With a quick glance at the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network), I was able to find out that eval() evaluates a string as if it were a mathematical expression and then returns the result. I also learned in the same MDN article that eval() should never be used in live code because it poses a potential security risk and can be slower than other alternatives when run in the browser. Keeping the warning in mind, I realized that this function could still be used at least for the coding challenges I was doing, and ended up using it as a shortcut to solve a much more difficult challenge about a month later.
